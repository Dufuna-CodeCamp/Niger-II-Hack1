            In the context of the Black Lives Matter movement and COVID-19,
             it is time to rethink notions of public safety and public health. 
            In fact, it is time to see that ‘being safe is a key dimension of being healthy,’ 
            said Prof. Hedwig Lee, a health disparities expert, in an exclusive interview for MNT.

            The Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests raised concerns, at the time, that they would cause
            COVID-19 cases to spike. Some people used these concerns to discredit the protests and the
            public health experts that supported them. However, the protests did not raise COVID-19 rates 
            and called the notion of public health into question. It is becoming increasingly apparent 
            that we can no longer ignore social determinants of health, such as poverty or racial discrimination.
            Police brutality is a public health issue, and so is racism.Furthermore, in some communities, 
            a police presence makes the members of those communities feel anything but safe. This begs the 
            question — what does public safety mean? What is the relationship between public safety and 
            public health? For answers, we turned to Hedwig Lee, a professor of sociology at Washington 
            University in St. Louis (WUSTL). Prof. Lee’s research interests include health disparities,
            race, and policing and social control. She is also the associate director of the Center for 
            the Study of Race, Ethnicity, and Equity at WUST We started by inquiring about public safety 
            and public health as if they were two separate notions, but Prof. Lee challenged us to “flip 
            the script.”

            It is time to understand that “Being safe is a key dimension of being healthy,” she said. 
            Also, in the context of “over-policing” and how it affects Black communities, in particular, 
            it is worth bearing in mind that ‘safety’ may mean different things for different people, and
            this may depend on where people live. We talked to Prof. Lee about the legacy of racial violence 
            in the United States, policing, COVID-19, wealth inequality, and how all of these aspects are
            interconnected into a broader picture of health. We have lightly edited the interview for clarity.
            MNT: In the context of the BLM protests and COVID-19, it seems like a good time to rethink the 
            concept of public health and what it means for different communities. Is there a tension between
            public safety and public health? Can the former be detrimental to the latter? Prof. Lee: I’ve
            been thinking a lot about your questions, and I think, coming from my perspective as a person
            who studies the social determinants of health, it’s hard for me sometimes to disentangle public
            safety from public health. [C]OVID has changed the entire world, and in the U.S., I think it really helped to amplify what racial inequalities actually mean. I think one of the reasons it did that is because it shows that all health outcomes are related. It shows that there’s no such thing as a public health policy or a criminal justice policy or an education policy, but that economic policy impacts health outcomes, that education policy impacts health outcomes, etc.
